Visualization of sorthing method called Bubble sort.

**HOW TO USE:**

1. Pygame lib is required in order for this program to work.
2. Choose density of noise.
3. Press Enter to generate noise.
4. After the noise is generated, press enter again to start sorting algorithm.
5. If noise density is too big, sorting will take long time (Bubble sort is one of worst time complexity sorts), you can skip to the end by pressing 'Space' continuously until it skips to sorted noise.
